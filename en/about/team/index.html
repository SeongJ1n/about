                During her high school days, Jay drew inspiration from Steve Jobs’s creation of the iPod—later becoming a driving force for creating StyleShare during her college days. Even though she double majored in Electrical/Electronics Engineering and Psychology, Jay’s love for fashion pushed her to create a global fashion platform. Nurturing her dream and StyleShare’s future direction, Jay takes every day one step at time with her dedicated team.

              <p class="ss-memeber-description">
                The best way to describe Hyunjun is that he is 70% programming wizard, 20% coffee addict, and 10% hipster. In all honesty, Hyunjun enjoys spending his days off at cafes sipping on iced americanos. The first thing we ask those who first join the StyleShare team is to guess Hyunjun’s age—so far no one has guessed correctly. Shockingly, many view his demeanor as an experienced programmer reflecting a much older age.

Bomin has been happily working at StyleShare after looking for a job where she could have fun while contributing as a programmer. Don’t let her bubbly personality fool you, Bomin is always on the hunt for any bugs on StyleShare’s Android platform.

                Searching for a challenge, Jihyun is always looking for activities to try. Whether it is scuba diving, paragliding, rock climbing, or crossfit, Jihyun has tried them all. It is no surprise that Jihyun is a certified barista—making him popular in an office full of coffee addicts. Although Jihyun serves as an experienced mentor for our programmers, he is the most energetic within the Engineering Team.

Not satisfied with working the typical 9-to-5 job, Jinsu’s entrepreneurial spirit has led him to become a part of the StyleShare family.

                Optimistic and eager to learn, Suyeol is always looking for something new to work on. Although he is the newest addition to the team, it seems as if Suyeol has been with StyleShare since the beginning. Before StyleShare, Suyeol founded his own startup called Joyfl, allowing him to understand the importance of a well-balanced team. Whether it is working on back end projects or developing internal tools, Suyeol makes sure that he produces a more than satisfying end-product.

As a result, she came to understand the characteristics of good content and the skills of community management. Just as Hyunyoung provides the office a positive vibes, she enjoys spending time with the StyleShare team. Even though the office teases her due to her indecisive personality, Hyunyoung takes it in all with love. Like the rest of the StyleShare girls, she is always on a ‘diet’.

Chaeyon has turned her childhood dream of working in the fashion industry into a reality with StyleShare. Outside of the office, Chaeyeon enjoys getting to know new people, including their likes/dislikes and even any embarrassing stories they try to hide.
